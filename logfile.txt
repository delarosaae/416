'The Three Musketeers' ( ) is a historical adventure novel written in 1844 by
French author Alexandre Dumas.

Situated between 1625 and 1628, it recounts the adventures of a young man named
d'Artagnan (based on Charles de Batz-Castelmore d'Artagnan) after he leaves home
to travel to Paris, to join the Musketeers of the Guard. Although d'Artagnan is
not able to join this elite corps immediately, he befriends the three most
formidable musketeers of the age ‚Äì Athos, Porthos and Aramis, "the three
inseparables," as these are called ‚Äì and gets involved in affairs of the state
and court.

In genre, The Three Musketeers is primarily a historical and adventure novel.
However, Dumas also frequently works into the plot various injustices, abuses,
and absurdities of the old regime, giving the novel an additional political
aspect at a time when the debate in France between republicans and monarchists
was still fierce. The story was first serialised from March to July 1844, during
the July Monarchy, four years before the French Revolution of 1848 violently
established the Second Republic.

The story of d'Artagnan is continued in [[Twenty Years After]] and [[The Vicomte
of Bragelonne: Ten Years Later]].

}} 'Oscar-Claude Monet' (; ; 14 November 1840&nbsp;‚Äì 5 December 1926) was a
French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most
consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing
one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape
painting.House, John, et al.: Monet in the 20th century, page 2, Yale University
Press, 1998. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting
Impression, soleil levant ([[Impression, Sunrise]]), which was exhibited in 1874
in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates
as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.

Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method
of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light
and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he
purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which
included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In
1899, he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a
Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale
paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.

'France' (), officially the 'French Republic' (, ), is a country whose territory
consists of metropolitan France in Western Europe and several overseas regions
and territories. The metropolitan area of France extends from the Mediterranean
Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic
Ocean. It is bordered by Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany to the northeast,
Switzerland and Italy to the east, and Andorra and Spain to the south. The
overseas territories include French Guiana in South America and several islands
in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. The country's 18 integral regions
(five of which are situated overseas) span a combined area of and a total
population of 67.3 million (). France, a sovereign state, is a unitary semi-
presidential republic with its capital in Paris, the country's largest city and
main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban areas include Lyon,
Marseille, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Lille and Nice.

During the Iron Age, what is now metropolitan France was inhabited by the Gauls,
a Celtic people. Rome annexed the area in 51 BC, holding it until the arrival of
Germanic Franks in 476, who formed the Kingdom of Francia. The Treaty of Verdun
of 843 partitioned Francia into East Francia, Middle Francia and West Francia.
West Francia which became the Kingdom of France in 987 emerged as a major
European power in the Late Middle Ages following its victory in the Hundred
Years' War (1337‚Äì1453). During the Renaissance, French culture flourished and a
global colonial empire was established, which by the 20th century would become
the second largest in the world. The 16th century was dominated by religious
civil wars between Catholics and Protestants (Huguenots). France became Europe's
dominant cultural, political, and military power in the 17th century under Louis
XIV. In the late 18th century, the French Revolution overthrew the absolute
monarchy, established one of modern history's earliest republics, and saw the
drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which
expresses the nation's ideals to this day.

In the 19th century, Napoleon took power and established the First French
Empire. His subsequent Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì15) shaped the course of
continental Europe. Following the collapse of the Empire, France endured a
tumultuous succession of governments culminating with the establishment of the
French Third Republic in 1870. France was a major participant in World War I,
from which it emerged victorious, and was one of the Allies in World War II,
but came under occupation by the Axis powers in 1940. Following liberation in
1944, a Fourth Republic was established and later dissolved in the course of
the Algerian War. The Fifth Republic, led by Charles de Gaulle, was formed in
1958 and remains today. Algeria and nearly all the other colonies became
independent in the 1960s and typically retained close economic and military
connections with France.

France has long been a global centre of art, science, and philosophy. It hosts
the world's fourth-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites and is the
leading tourist destination, receiving around 83&nbsp;million foreign visitors
annually. France is a developed country with the world's sixth-largest economy
by nominal GDP, and tenth-largest by purchasing power parity. In terms of
aggregate household wealth, it ranks fourth in the world. France performs well
in international rankings of education, health care, life expectancy, and human
development. France is considered a great power in global affairs,Jack S. Levy,
War in the Modern Great Power System, 1495‚Äì1975, (2014) p. 29 being one of the
five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to
veto and an official nuclear-weapon state. It is a leading member state of the
European Union and the Eurozone, and a member of the Group of 7, North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO), Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), and La Francophonie.

'Rome' (Latin and ) is the capital city and a special [[comune]] of Italy (named
Comune di Roma Capitale). Rome also serves as the capital of the Lazio region.
With 2,872,800 residents in , it is also the country's most populated comune. It
is the fourth most populous city in the European Union by population within city
limits. It is the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, which has a
population of 4,355,725 residents, thus making it the most populous metropolitan
city in Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of the Italian
Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican
City (the smallest country in the world) is an independent country inside the
city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city:
for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.

Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of
Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it
one of the oldest continuously occupied sites in Europe.Heiken, G., Funiciello,
R. and De Rita, D. (2005), The Seven Hills of Rome: A Geological Tour of the
Eternal City. Princeton University Press. The city's early population originated
from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively
became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman
Empire, and is regarded by some as the first ever metropolis. It was first
called The Eternal City (; ) by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC,
and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy.Stephanie Malia
Hom, "Consuming the View: Tourism, Rome, and the Topos of the Eternal City",
Annali d'Igtalianistica '28':91‚Äì116 Rome is also called the "Caput Mundi"
(Capital of the World). After the fall of the Western Empire, which marked the
beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of
the Papacy, and in the 8th century it became the capital of the Papal States,
which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the Renaissance, almost all the popes
since Nicholas V (1447‚Äì1455) pursued over four hundred years a coherent
architectural and urban programme aimed at making the city the artistic and
cultural centre of the world. In this way, Rome became first one of the major
centres of the Italian Renaissance, and then the birthplace of both the Baroque
style and Neoclassicism. Famous artists, painters, sculptors and architects made
Rome the centre of their activity, creating masterpieces throughout the city. In
1871, Rome became the capital of the Kingdom of Italy, which, in 1946, became

'Ohio' is a Midwestern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States.
Of the fifty states, it is the 34th largest by area, the seventh most
populous, and the tenth most densely populated. The state's capital and
largest city is Columbus.

The state takes its name from the Ohio River, whose name in turn originated from
the Seneca word ohiÀêyo', meaning "good river", "great river" or "large creek".
Partitioned from the Northwest Territory, Ohio was the 17th state admitted to
the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance. Ohio is
historically known as the "Buckeye State" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and
Ohioans are also known as "Buckeyes".

Ohio rose from the wilderness of Ohio Country west of Appalachia in colonial
times through the Northwest Indian Wars as part of the Northwest Territory in
the early frontier, to become the first non-colonial free state admitted to the
union, to an industrial powerhouse in the 20th century before transmogrifying to
a more information and service based economy in the 21st.

The government of Ohio is composed of the executive branch, led by the Governor;
the legislative branch, which comprises the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and
the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. Ohio occupies 16 seats in
the United States House of Representatives. Ohio is known for its status as both
a swing state and a bellwether in national elections.{{cite web

'John Fitzgerald "Jack" Kennedy' (May 29, 1917 ‚Äì November 22, 1963), commonly
referred to by his initials 'JFK', was an American politician and journalist who
served as the 35th president of the United States from January 1961 until his
assassination in November 1963. He served at the height of the Cold War, and the
majority of his presidency dealt with managing relations with the Soviet Union.
A member of the Democratic Party, Kennedy represented Massachusetts in the U.S.
House of Representatives and Senate prior to becoming president.

Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, the second child of Joseph P.
Kennedy Sr. and Rose Kennedy. He graduated from Harvard University in 1940 and
joined the U.S. Naval Reserve the following year. During World War II, he
commanded a series of PT boats in the Pacific theater and earned the Navy and
Marine Corps Medal for his service. After the war, Kennedy represented the 11th
congressional district of Massachusetts in the U.S. House of Representatives
from 1947 to 1953. He was subsequently elected to the U.S. Senate and served as
the junior Senator from Massachusetts from 1953 to 1960. While in the Senate, he
published his book [[Profiles in Courage]], which won a Pulitzer Prize for
Biography. In the 1960 presidential election, Kennedy narrowly defeated
Republican opponent Richard Nixon, who was the incumbent vice president. At age
43, he became the second-youngest man to serve as president (after Theodore
Roosevelt), the youngest man to be elected as U.S. president, as well as the
only Roman Catholic to occupy that office. He was also the first president to
have served in the U.S. Navy.

Kennedy's time in office was marked by high tensions with communist states in
the Cold War. He increased the number of American military advisers in South
Vietnam by a factor of 18 over President Dwight D. Eisenhower. In April 1961, he
authorized a failed joint-CIA attempt to overthrow the Cuban government of Fidel
Castro in the Bay of Pigs Invasion.de Quesada, Alejandro The Bay of Pigs: Cuba
1961 (2011) p. 17 He subsequently rejected Operation Northwoods plans by the
Joint Chiefs of Staff to orchestrate false flag attacks on American soil in
order to gain public approval for a war against Cuba. However his administration
continued to plan for an invasion of Cuba in the summer of 1962.https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/User Question: When is Festivus?

}}

'Festivus' is a secular holiday celebrated on December 23 as an alternative to
the pressures and commercialism of the Christmas season. Originally created by
author Daniel O'Keefe, Festivus entered popular culture after it was made the
focus of the 1997 [[Seinfeld]] episode "The Strike", which O'Keefe's son, Dan
O'Keefe, co-wrote.

The non-commercial holiday's celebration, as depicted on Seinfeld, occurs on
December 23 and includes a Festivus dinner, an unadorned aluminum Festivus pole,
practices such as the "Airing of Grievances" and "Feats of Strength", and the
labeling of easily explainable events as "Festivus miracles". The episode refers
to it as "a Festivus for the rest of us".

It has been described both as a parody holiday festival and as a form of playful
consumer resistance. Journalist Allen Salkin describes it as "the perfect
secular theme for an all-inclusive December gathering".

The traditional Christmas narrative, the Nativity of Jesus, delineated in the
New Testament says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with
messianic prophecies. When Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no
room and so they were offered a stable where the Christ Child was soon born,
with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the
information.

Although the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, the church in the early
fourth century fixed the date as December 25.Corinna Laughlin, Michael R.

solstice on the Roman calendar. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the
Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil
calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, some Eastern
Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian
calendar, which currently corresponds to a January date in the Gregorian
calendar. For Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of
man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is
considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.

The celebratory customs associated in various countries with Christmas have a
mix of , Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of
the holiday include gift giving, completing an Advent calendar or Advent wreath,
Christmas music and caroling, lighting a Christingle, viewing a Nativity play,
an exchange of Christmas cards, church services, a special meal, pulling
Christmas crackers and the display of various Christmas decorations, including
Christmas trees, Christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths,
mistletoe, and holly. In addition, several closely related and often
interchangeable figures, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas,
and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the
Christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. Because gift-
giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened
economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales
period for retailers and businesses. The economic impact of Christmas has grown
steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.

'George Washington' (February 22, 1732}} ‚Äì , 1799) was an American political
leader, military general, statesman, and Founding Father who also served as the
first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797. He led Patriot forces to
victory in the nation's War of Independence, and he presided at the
Constitutional Convention of 1787 which established the new federal government.
He has been called the "Father of His Country" for his manifold leadership in
the formative days of the new nation.

Washington received his initial military training and command with the Virginia
Regiment during the French and Indian War. He was later elected to the Virginia
House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress, where
he was appointed Commanding General of the nation's Continental Army. Washington
led American forces, allied with France, in the defeat and surrender of the
British at Yorktown, and resigned his commission in 1783.

Washington played a key role in the adoption and ratification of the
Constitution and was then elected president by the Electoral College in the
first two elections. He implemented a strong, well-financed national government
while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry between cabinet members Thomas
Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton. During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a
policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty. He set enduring
precedents for the office of president, including the title "President of the
United States", and his Farewell Address is widely regarded as a pre-eminent
statement on republicanism.

Washington utilized slave labor, owning and trading African American slaves, but
he became troubled with the institution of slavery and freed them in his 1799
will. He endeavored to assimilate Native Americans into Western culture, but
responded to their brutality with military aggression. He was a member of the
Anglican Church and the Freemasons, and he urged tolerance for all religions in
his roles as general and president. Upon his death, he was eulogized as "first
in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen." He has been
memorialized by monuments, art, geographical locations, stamps, and currency,
and many scholars and polls rank him among the top American presidents.

}} 'Oscar-Claude Monet' (; ; 14 November 1840&nbsp;‚Äì 5 December 1926) was a
French painter, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most
consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing
one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape
painting.House, John, et al.: Monet in the 20th century, page 2, Yale University
Press, 1998. The term "Impressionism" is derived from the title of his painting
Impression, soleil levant ([[Impression, Sunrise]]), which was exhibited in 1874
in the first of the independent exhibitions mounted by Monet and his associates
as an alternative to the Salon de Paris.

Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method
of painting the same scene many times in order to capture the changing of light
and the passing of the seasons. From 1883, Monet lived in Giverny, where he
purchased a house and property and began a vast landscaping project which
included lily ponds that would become the subjects of his best-known works. In
1899, he began painting the water lilies, first in vertical views with a
Japanese bridge as a central feature and later in the series of large-scale
paintings that was to occupy him continuously for the next 20 years of his life.



Answer: Monet's ambition of documenting the French countryside led him to adopt a method

The 'Great Barrier Reef' is the world's largest coral reef system composed of
over 2,900 individual reefsThe Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area, which is
348,000&nbsp;km squared, has 2900 reefs. However, this does not include the
reefs found in the Torres Strait, which has an estimated area of 37,000&nbsp;km
squared and with a possible 750 reefs and shoals. and 900 islands stretching for
over over an area of approximately . The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off
the coast of Queensland, Australia. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from
outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living
organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny
organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was
selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the seven
natural wonders of the world. The Queensland National Trust named it a state
icon of Queensland.

A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park,
which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other
environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff, climate
change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and
cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a
study published in October 2012 by the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences]], the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985.

The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal
Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local
groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for
tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an
important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3&nbsp;billion
per year. In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D
of the Great Barrier Reef.

A March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than
previously thought, seriously affecting the northern parts of the reef as a
result of warming ocean temperatures. In October 2016, [[Outside
(magazine)|Outside]] published an obituary for the reef; the article was
criticized for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the resilience
of the reef. In March 2017, the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] published a
paper showing that huge sections of an 800-kilometre (500 mi) stretch in the
northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 due to high water
temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global
climate change.

User Question: What is a cat?

{{Speciesbox |name= Domestic cat |status= DOM

|image = Cat poster 1.jpg |image_upright = 1.2 |image_caption = Various types of
domestic cat |genus = Felis |species = catus |authority =(Linnaeus, 1758)
|synonyms= *F. catus domesticus *F. angorensis *F. vulgaris }} The 'cat' (Felis
catus) is a small carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the
family Felidae and often referred to as the 'domestic cat' to distinguish it
from wild members of the family. The cat is either a 'house cat', kept as a pet,
or a '[[feral cat]]', freely ranging and avoiding human contact. A house cat is
valued by humans for companionship and for its ability to hunt rodents. About 60
cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.

Cats are similar in anatomy to the other felid species, with a strong flexible
body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small
prey. They are predators who are most active at dawn and dusk (crepuscular).
Cats can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as
those made by mice and other small animals. Compared to humans, they see better
in the dark (they see in near total darkness) and have a better sense of smell,
but poorer color vision. Cats, despite being solitary hunters, are a social
species. Cat communication includes the use of vocalizations including mewing,
purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body
language. Cats also communicate by secreting and perceiving pheromones.

Female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter
sizes ranging from two to five kittens. Domestic cats can be bred and shown as
registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. Failure to control the
breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets,
has resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the
extinction of entire bird species, and evoking population control.

It was long thought that cat domestication was initiated in Egypt, because cats
in ancient Egypt were venerated since around 3100 BC. However, the earliest
indication for the taming of an African wildcat (F. lybica) was found in Cyprus,
where a cat skeleton was excavated close by a human Neolithic grave dating to
around 7500 BC. African wildcats were probably first domesticated in the Near
East. The leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) was tamed independently in
China around 5500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no
trace in the domestic cat populations of today.

As of 2017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the U.S. by
number of pets owned, after freshwater fish, with 95 million cats owned. As of
2017, it was ranked the third-most popular pet in the UK, after fish and dogs,
with around 8 million being owned. The number of cats in the UK has nearly
doubled since 1965, when the cat population was 4.1 million.

'Birds', also known as 'Aves', are a group of endothermic vertebrates,
characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled
eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a strong yet
lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee
hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically-successful
class of tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species, more than
half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds have
which are more or less developed depending on the species; the only known groups
without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from
forelimbs, gave birds the ability to fly, although further evolution has led to
the loss of flight in flightless birds, including ratites, penguins, and diverse
endemic island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds
are also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments,
particularly seabirds and some waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.

The fossil record demonstrates that birds are modern feathered dinosaurs, having
evolved from earlier feathered dinosaurs within the theropod group, which are
traditionally placed within the saurischian dinosaurs. The closest living
relatives of birds are the crocodilians. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs that lie
outside class Aves proper, in the broader group Avialae, have been found dating
back to the mid-Jurassic period, around 170 million years ago. Many of these
early "stem-birds", such as [[Archaeopteryx]], were not yet capable of fully
powered flight, and many retained primitive characteristics like toothy jaws in
place of beaks, and long bony tails. DNA-based evidence finds that birds
diversified dramatically around the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPalaeogene extinction
event 66 million years ago, which killed off the pterosaurs and all the non-
avian dinosaur lineages. But birds, especially those in the southern continents,
survived this event and then migrated to other parts of the world while
diversifying during periods of global cooling. This makes them the sole
surviving dinosaurs according to cladistics.

Some birds, especially corvids and parrots, are among the most intelligent
animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass
on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many
species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with
visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social
behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, flocking, and mobbing of
predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring
to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one
breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other
species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with
many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many
males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through
sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the
parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching.
Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised
eggs do not produce offspring.

Many species of birds are economically important as food for human consumption
and raw material in manufacturing, with domesticated and undomesticated birds
(poultry and game) being important sources of eggs, meat, and feathers.
Songbirds, parrots, and other species are popular as pets. Guano (bird
excrement) is harvested for use as a fertiliser. Birds prominently figure
throughout human culture. About 120‚Äì130 species have become extinct due to human
activity since the 17th century, and hundreds more before then. Human activity
threatens about 1,200 bird species with extinction, though efforts are underway
to protect them. Recreational birdwatching is an important part of the
ecotourism industry.

'Fish' are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous
and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged
within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However,
traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e.,
the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the
same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as
a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in
systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including
tetrapods. The traditional term 'pisces' (also 'ichthyes') is considered a , but
not a phylogenetic classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates
that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true
spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their
invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic
era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic
developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with
jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became
formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.

Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to
vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers
like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of
acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission
of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production
of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the
context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour. The sounds emitted by
fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. They can produce
either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can
produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the
swimbladder.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all
aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the
abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and
anglerfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of
the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity
than any other group of vertebrates.

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food.
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing)
or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are
also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and
exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture through the
ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art,
books and movies.

'Yellow' is the color between orange and green on the spectrum of visible light.
It is evoked by light with a dominant wavelength of roughly 570590 nm. It is a
primary color in subtractive color systems, used in painting or color printing.
In the RGB color model, used to create colors on television and computer
screens, yellow is a secondary color made by combining red and green at equal
intensity. Carotenoids give the characteristic yellow color to autumn leaves,
corn, canaries, daffodils, and lemons, as well as egg yolks, buttercups, and
bananas. They absorb light energy and protect plants from photodamage. Sunlight
has a slight yellowish hue, due to the surface temperature of the sun.


Because it was widely available, yellow ochre pigment was one of the first
colors used in art; the Lascaux cave in France has a painting of a yellow horse
17,000 years old. Ochre and orpiment pigments were used to represent gold and
skin color in Egyptian tombs, then in the murals in Roman villas. In the early
Christian church, yellow was the color associated with the Pope and the golden
keys of the Kingdom, but was also associated with Judas Iscariot and was used to
mark heretics. In the 20th century, Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe were forced to
wear a yellow star. In China, bright yellow was the color of the Middle Kingdom,
and could be worn only by the Emperor and his household; special guests were
welcomed on a yellow carpet.Cited in Eva Heller (2000), Psychologie de la
couleur ‚Äì effets et symboliques, p. 82.


According to surveys in Europe, Canada, and the United States, yellow is the
color people most often associate with amusement, gentleness, humor, and
spontaneity, but also with duplicity, envy, jealousy, avarice, and, in the U.S.,
with cowardice.Eva Heller (2000), Psychologie de la couleur ‚Äì effets et
symboliques, pp. 69‚Äì86. In Iran it has connotations of pallor/sickness, but also
wisdom and connection. In China and many Asian countries, it is seen as the
color of happiness, glory, harmony and wisdom.Eva Heller (2000), Psychologie de

The 'carrot' ([[Daucus carota]] subsp. sativus) is a root vegetable, usually
orange in colour, though purple, black, red, white, and yellow cultivars exist.
Carrots are a domesticated form of the wild carrot, Daucus carota, native to
Europe and southwestern Asia. The plant probably originated in Persia and was
originally cultivated for its leaves and seeds. The most commonly eaten part of
the plant is the taproot, although the stems and leaves are eaten as well. The
domestic carrot has been selectively bred for its greatly enlarged, more
palatable, less woody-textured taproot.

The carrot is a biennial plant in the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it
grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing
cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-
maturing cultivars need a month longer (120 days). The roots contain high
quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are a good source of vitamin K and
vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision is a myth
put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their
military capabilities.

The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reports that world
production of carrots and turnips (these plants are combined by the FAO) for the
calendar year 2013 was 37.2 million tonnes; almost half (~45%) were grown in
China. Carrots are widely used in many cuisines, especially in the preparation
of salads, and carrot salads are a tradition in many regional cuisines.

In cell biology, the 'cytoplasm' is all of the material within a cell, enclosed
by the cell membrane, except for the cell nucleus. The material inside the
nucleus and contained within the nuclear membrane is termed the nucleoplasm. The
main components of the cytoplasm are cytosol ‚Äì a gel-like substance, the
organelles ‚Äì the cell's internal sub-structures, and various cytoplasmic
inclusions. The cytoplasm is about 80% water and usually colorless.

The submicroscopic ground cell substance, or cytoplasmatic matrix which remains
after exclusion the cell organelles and particles is groundplasm. It is the
hyaloplasm of light microscopy, and high complex, polyphasic system in which all
of resolvable cytoplasmic elements of are suspended, including the larger
organelles such as the ribosomes, mitochondria, the plant plastids, lipid
droplets, and vacuoles.

Most cellular activities take place within the cytoplasm, such as many metabolic
pathways including glycolysis, and processes such as cell division. The
concentrated inner area is called the endoplasm and the outer layer is called
the cell cortex or the ectoplasm.

Movement of calcium ions in and out of the cytoplasm is a signaling activity for
metabolic processes.Hogan, C. Michael (2010).

As a physical object, a 'book' is a stack of usually rectangular pages (made of
papyrus, parchment, vellum, or paper) oriented with one edge tied, sewn, or
otherwise fixed together and then bound to the flexible spine of a protective
cover of heavier, relatively inflexible material.IEILS, p. 41 The technical term
for this physical arrangement is ''codex'' (in the plural, codices). In the
history of hand-held physical supports for extended written compositions or
records, the codex replaces its immediate predecessor, the scroll. A single
sheet in a codex is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page.

As an intellectual object, a book is prototypically a composition of such great
length that it takes a considerable investment of time to compose and a still
considerable, though not so extensive, investment of time to read. This sense of
book has a restricted and an unrestricted sense. In the restricted sense, a book
is a self-sufficient section or part of a longer composition, a usage that
reflects the fact that, in antiquity, long works had to be written on several
scrolls, and each scroll had to be identified by the book it contained. So, for
instance, each part of Aristotle's [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] is called a
book, as of course the Bible encompasses many different books. In the
unrestricted sense, a book is the compositional whole of which such sections,
whether called books or chapters or parts, are parts.

The intellectual content in a physical book need not be a composition, nor even
be called a book. Books can consist only of drawings, engravings, or
photographs, or such things as crossword puzzles or cut-out dolls. In a physical
book the pages can be left blank or can feature an abstract set of lines as
support for on-going entries, i.e., an account book, an appointment book, a log
book, an autograph book, a notebook, a diary or day book, or a sketch book. Some
physical books are made with pages thick and sturdy enough to support other
physical objects, like a scrapbook or photograph album. Books may be distributed
in electronic form as e-books and other formats.

Although in ordinary academic parlance a monograph is understood to be a
specialist academic work, rather than a reference work on a single scholarly
subject, in library and information science monograph denotes more broadly any
non-serial publication complete in one volume (book) or a finite number of
volumes (even a novel like Proust's seven-volume [[In Search of Lost Time]]), in
contrast to serial publications like a magazine, journal, or newspaper. An avid
reader or collector of books or a book lover is a bibliophile or colloquially,
"bookworm". A shop where books are bought and sold is a bookshop or bookstore.
Books are also sold elsewhere. Books can also be borrowed from libraries. Google
has estimated that as of 2010, approximately 130,000,000 distinct titles had
been published. In some wealthier nations, the sale of printed books has
decreased because of the use of e-books, though sales of e-books declined in the
first half of 2015.

A 'wristwatch' is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch
strap or other type of bracelet. A '[[pocket watch]]' is designed for a person
to carry in a pocket. The study of timekeeping is known as horology.

Watches progressed in the 17th&nbsp;century from spring-powered clocks, which
appeared as early as the 14th&nbsp;century. During most of its history the watch
was a mechanical device, driven by clockwork, powered by winding a mainspring,
and keeping time with an oscillating balance wheel. These are called
[[mechanical watch]]es. Christopher Ward QUARTZ VS AUTOMATIC|website=www.christopherward.com|access-date=2018-11-
27}} Est.1897|website=est1897.co.uk|access-date=2018-11-27}} In the 1960s the
electronic ''quartz watch'' was invented, which was powered by a battery and
kept time with a vibrating quartz crystal. By the 1980s the quartz watch had
taken over most of the market from the mechanical watch. Historically, this is
called the quartz revolution. Developments in the 2010s include
''smartwatches'', which are elaborate computer-like electronic devices designed
to be worn on a wrist. They generally incorporate timekeeping functions, but
these are only a small subset of the smartwatch's facilities.

In general, modern watches often display the day, date, month and year. For
mechanical watches, various extra features called "complications", such as
moon-phase displays and the different types of tourbillon, are sometimes
included.Wikipedia: sections under Functions. Most electronic quartz watches,
on the other hand, include time-related features such as timers, chronographs
and alarm functions. Furthermore, some modern smartwatches even incorporate
calculators, GPS and Bluetooth technology or have heart-rate monitoring
capabilities, and some of them use radio clock technology to regularly
correct the time.

Today, most watches in the market that are inexpensive and medium-priced, used
mainly for timekeeping, have quartz movements. However, expensive collectible
watches, valued more for their elaborate craftsmanship, aesthetic appeal and
glamorous design than for simple timekeeping, often have traditional mechanical
movements, even though they are less accurate and more expensive than electronic
ones. As of 2018, the most expensive watch ever sold at auction is the Patek

Switzerland]]

A 'bag' (also known regionally as a 'sack') is a common tool in the form of a
non-rigid container. The use of bags predates recorded history, with the
earliest bags being no more than lengths of animal skin, cotton, or woven plant
fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the
same material.Farid Chenoune, Carried Away: All About Bags (2005).

Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the development of
human civilization, as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such
as berries or food grains, and to transport more items than could readily be
carried in the hands. The word probably has its origins in the Norse word baggi,
from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European b ∞ak, but is also comparable to the
Welsh baich (load, bundle), and the Greek Œ≤Œ¨œÉœÑŒ±Œ≥ŒºŒ± (b√°stagma, load).

Cheap disposable paper bags and plastic shopping bags are very common in the
retail trade as a convenience for shoppers, and are often supplied by the shop

Computer science deals with the theoretical foundations of computation and
practical techniques for their application.




'Computer science' is the study of processes that interact with data and that
can be represented as data in the form of programs. It enables the use of
algorithms to manipulate, store, and communicate digital information. A computer
scientist studies the theory of computation and the practice of designing
software systems.

Its fields can be divided into theoretical and practical disciplines.
Computational complexity theory is highly abstract, while computer graphics
emphasizes real-world applications. Programming language theory considers
approaches to the description of computational processes, while computer
programming itself involves the use of programming languages and complex
systems. Human‚Äìcomputer interaction considers the challenges in making computers
useful, usable, and accessible.

'Life' is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have
biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from
those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died),
or because they never had such functions and are classified as . Various forms
of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria.
The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses,
viroids, or potential synthetic life as "living". Biology is the science
concerned with the study of life.

There is currently no consensus regarding the definition of life. One popular
definition is that organisms are open systems that maintain homeostasis, are
composed of cells, have a life cycle, undergo metabolism, can grow, adapt to
their environment, respond to stimuli, reproduce and evolve. However, several
other definitions have been proposed, and there are some borderline cases of
life, such as viruses or viroids.

Abiogenesis is the natural process of life arising from non-living matter, such
as simple organic compounds. The prevailing scientific hypothesis is that the
transition from non-living to living entities was not a single event, but a
gradual process of increasing complexity. Life on Earth first appeared as early
as 4.28 billion years ago, soon after ocean formation 4.41 billion years ago,
and not long after the formation of the Earth 4.54 billion years ago. The
earliest known life forms are microfossils of bacteria. Researchers generally
think that current life on Earth descends from an RNA world,*
*
* : "There is now strong evidence indicating that an RNA World did indeed exist
  before DNA- and protein-based life."
* : "[The RNA world's existence] has broad support within the community today."
  although RNA-based life may not have been the first life to have existed. The
  classic 1952 Miller‚ÄìUrey experiment and similar research demonstrated that
  most amino acids, the chemical constituents of the proteins used in all living
  organisms, can be synthesized from inorganic compounds under conditions
  intended to replicate those of the early Earth. Complex organic molecules
  occur in the Solar System and in interstellar space, and these molecules may
  have provided starting material for the development of life on Earth.

Since its primordial beginnings, life on Earth has changed its environment on a
geologic time scale, but it has also adapted to survive in most ecosystems and
conditions. Some microorganisms, called extremophiles, thrive in physically or
geochemically extreme environments that are detrimental to most other life on
Earth. The cell is considered the structural and functional unit of life.[https://www.scribd.com/doc/14425949/Cell-The-Fundamental-Unit-of-
Life Chapter-5, The Fundamental Unit of Life]. Monika Mehan. Scribd. There are
two kinds of cells, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, both of which consist of
cytoplasm enclosed within a membrane and contain many biomolecules such as
proteins and nucleic acids. Cells reproduce through a process of cell division,
in which the parent cell divides into two or more daughter cells.

In the past, there have been many attempts to define what is meant by "life"
through obsolete concepts such as odic force, hylomorphism, spontaneous
generation and vitalism, that have now been disproved by biological discoveries.
Aristotle was the first person to classify organisms. Later, Carl Linnaeus
introduced his system of binomial nomenclature for the classification of
species. Eventually new groups and categories of life were discovered, such as
cells and microorganisms, forcing dramatic revisions of the structure of
relationships between living organisms. Though currently only known on Earth,
life need not be restricted to it, and many scientists speculate in the
existence of extraterrestrial life. Artificial life is a computer simulation or
man-made reconstruction of any aspect of life, which is often used to examine
systems related to natural life.

Death is the permanent termination of all biological functions which sustain an
organism, and as such, is the end of its life. Extinction is the term describing
the dying out of a group or taxon, usually a species. Fossils are the preserved
remains or traces of organisms.

The 'Moon' is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth and is Earth's only
permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the
Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of
the planet that it orbits (its primary). The Moon is after Jupiter's satellite
Io the second-densest satellite in the Solar System among those whose densities
are known.

The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after
Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the
debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body
called Theia.

The Moon is in synchronous rotation with Earth, and thus always shows the same
side to Earth, the near side. The near side is marked by dark volcanic maria
that fill the spaces between the bright ancient crustal highlands and the
prominent impact craters. After the Sun, the Moon is the second-brightest
regularly visible celestial object in Earth's sky. Its surface is actually dark,
although compared to the night sky it appears very bright, with a reflectance
just slightly higher than that of worn asphalt. Its gravitational influence
produces the ocean tides, body tides, and the slight lengthening of the day.

The Moon's average orbital distance is , or 1.28 light-seconds. This is about
thirty times the diameter of Earth. The Moon's apparent size in the sky is
almost the same as that of the Sun, since the star is about 400 times the lunar
distance and diameter. Therefore, the Moon covers the Sun nearly precisely
during a total solar eclipse. This matching of apparent visual size will not
continue in the far future because the Moon's distance from Earth is gradually
increasing.

The Moon was first reached in September 1959 by the Soviet Union's Luna 2, an
unmanned spacecraft. The United States' NASA Apollo program achieved the only
manned lunar missions to date, beginning with the first manned orbital mission
by Apollo 8 in 1968, and six manned landings between 1969 and 1972, with the
first being Apollo 11. These missions returned lunar rocks which have been used
to develop a geological understanding of the Moon's origin, internal structure,
and the Moon's later history. Since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972, the Moon has
been visited only by unmanned spacecraft.

Both the Moon's natural prominence in the earthly sky and its regular cycle of
phases as seen from Earth have provided cultural references and influences for
human societies and cultures since time immemorial. Such cultural influences can
be found in language, lunar calendar systems, art, and mythology.

The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star (G2V) based on its spectral class. As
such, it is informally and not completely accurately referred to as a yellow
dwarf (its light is closer to white than yellow). It formed approximately 4.6
billionAll numbers in this article are short scale. One billion is 109, or
1,000,000,000. years ago from the gravitational collapse of matter within a
region of a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center,
whereas the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System.
The central mass became so hot and dense that it eventually initiated nuclear
fusion in its core. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.

The Sun is roughly middle-aged; it has not changed dramatically for more than
four billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five
billion years. It currently fuses about 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium
every second, converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a
result. This energy, which can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape
from its core, is the source of the Sun's light and heat. In about 5 billion
years, when hydrogen fusion in its core has diminished to the point at which the
Sun is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked
increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually
become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large
to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth
uninhabitable. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a dense type
of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer produce energy by fusion,
but still glow and give off heat from its previous fusion.

The enormous effect of the Sun on Earth has been recognized since prehistoric
times, and the Sun has been regarded by some cultures as a deity. The synodic
rotation of Earth and its orbit around the Sun are the basis of solar calendars,
one of which is the predominant calendar in use today.

'Mars' is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the
Solar System after Mercury. In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of
war, and is often referred to as the "'Red Planet'" because the reddish iron
oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is
distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars is a
terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent
both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice
caps of Earth.

The days and seasons are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the
rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the
ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the largest
volcano and second-highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles
Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis
basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant
impact feature. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and
irregularly shaped. These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a
Mars trojan.

There are ongoing investigations assessing the past habitability potential of
Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. Future astrobiology missions
are planned, including the Mars 2020 and ExoMars rovers. Liquid water cannot
exist on the surface of Mars due to low atmospheric pressure, which is less than
1% of the Earth's, except at the lowest elevations for short periods. The two
polar ice caps appear to be made largely of water. The volume of water ice in
the south polar ice cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the entire
planetary surface to a depth of . In November 2016, NASA reported finding a
large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars. The
volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of
water in Lake Superior.

Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its reddish
coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches ‚àí2.94, which is surpassed only by
Jupiter, Venus, the Moon, and the Sun. Optical ground-based telescopes are
typically limited to resolving features about across when Earth and Mars are
closest because of Earth's atmosphere.

'Pollen' is a fine to coarse powdery substance comprising pollen grains which
are male microgametophytes of seed plants, which produce male gametes (sperm
cells). Pollen grains have a hard coat made of sporopollenin that protects the
gametophytes during the process of their movement from the stamens to the pistil
of flowering plants, or from the male cone to the female cone of coniferous
plants. If pollen lands on a compatible pistil or female cone, it germinates,
producing a pollen tube that transfers the sperm to the ovule containing the
female gametophyte. Individual pollen grains are small enough to require
magnification to see detail. The study of pollen is called palynology and is
highly useful in paleoecology, paleontology, archaeology, and forensics. Pollen
in plants is used for transferring haploid male genetic material from the anther
of a single flower to the stigma of another in cross-pollination. In a case of
self-pollination, this process takes place from the anther of a flower to the
stigma of the same flower.

Pollen is commonly used as food and food supplement. However, because of
agricultural practices, it is often contaminated by agricultural pesticides.

'Music' is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound organized in
time. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which
governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter,
and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of
timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of
these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal
techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental
pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment)
and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek
(mousike; "art of the Muses"). See glossary of musical terminology.

In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or
cultural activity include the creation of works of music (songs, tunes,
symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of
music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian
philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and
vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and
"it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and
pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any
sound can be music, saying, for example, "There is no noise, only sound."

The creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary
according to culture and social context. Indeed, throughout history, some new
forms or styles of music have been criticized as "not being music", including

Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Protest Music After Fukushima. Oxford
University Press, 2015. p. 163. There are many types of music, including popular
music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and
work songs such as chanteys. Music ranges from strictly organized
compositions‚Äìsuch as Classical music symphonies from the 1700s and 1800s,
through to spontaneously played improvisational music such as jazz, and avant-
garde styles of chance-based contemporary music from the 20th and 21st
centuries.

Music can be divided into genres (e.g., country music) and genres can be further
divided into subgenres (e.g., country blues and pop country are two of the many
country subgenres), although the dividing lines and relationships between music
genres are often subtle, sometimes open to personal interpretation, and
occasionally controversial. For example, it can be hard to draw the line between
some early 1980s hard rock and heavy metal. Within the arts, music may be
classified as a performing art, a fine art or as an auditory art. Music may be
played or sung and heard live at a rock concert or orchestra performance, heard
live as part of a dramatic work (a music theater show or opera), or it may be
recorded and listened to on a radio, MP3 player, CD player, smartphone or as
film score or TV show.

In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it
plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g.,
graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural
activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk
band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as a hobby, like a
teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or
singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and
musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform
music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and
conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers),
individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings,
sheet music, and scores to customers.

The 'Baroque' (, ) is a highly ornate and often extravagant style of
architecture, music, painting, sculpture and other arts that flourished in
Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century. It followed the
Renaissance style and preceded the Rococo (in the past often referred to as
"late Baroque") and Neoclassical styles. It was encouraged by the Catholic
Church as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of Protestant
architecture, art and music, though Lutheran Baroque art developed in parts of
Europe as well. The Baroque style used contrast, movement, exuberant detail,
deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe. The style began at
the start of the 17th century in Rome, then spread rapidly to France, northern
Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s,
it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called [[rocaille]] or
[[Rococo]], which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late
18th century.

 performing for the Mozart Year 2006 in Vienna]] 'Classical music' is art music

European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European
classical and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use
since about the 11th century. Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern
European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the
worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the
performer the pitches (which form the melodies, basslines and chords), tempo,
metre and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices
such as improvisation and [[ad libitum]] ornamentation, which are frequently
heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and
blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song
(strophic) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for
its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the
symphony, concerto, fugue, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such
as opera, cantata, and mass.Julian Johnson (2002) Who Needs Classical Music?:
Cultural Choice and Musical Value: p. 63.

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an
attempt to distinctly canonize the period from Johann Sebastian Bach to Ludwig
van Beethoven as a golden age.Rushton, Julian, Classical Music, (London, 1994),
10 The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the [[Oxford English
Dictionary]] is from about 1829.

User Question: What is temperament?



Search Was executed: temperament 


Wiki Result: 



In psychology, 'temperament' broadly refers to consistent individual differences
in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of
learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association
of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic
aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality.
Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) remain
its distinct patterns in behavior throughout adulthood but they are most
noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by
temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish
temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.

Although a broad definition of temperament is agreed upon, many classification
schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus.

Historically, the concept of temperament (originally "temperamentums" in Latin
means "mixtures") was a part of the theory of the four humors, with their
corresponding four temperaments.

This historical concept was explored by philosophers, psychologists,
psychiatrists and psycho-physiologists from very early times of psychological
science, with theories proposed by Immanuel Kant, Hermann Lotze, Ivan Pavlov,
Carl Jung, Gerardus Heymans among others.

More recently, scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality
have further examined the relationship between temperament and neurotransmitter
systemsDepue, R. & Fu, Y. (2012) Neurobiology and neurochemistry of temperament
in adults. In: Zentner, M. & Shiner, R. (Eds.) Handbook of Temperament. NY:
Guilford Publications, 368-399. (2012). and character (defined in this context
as developmental aspects of personality). However, biological correlations have
proven hard to confirm.

A 'mold' () or 'mould' ( is a fungus that grows in the form of multicellular
filaments called [[hyphae]]. In contrast, fungi that can adopt a single-celled
growth habit are called yeasts.

Molds are a large and taxonomically diverse number of fungal species in which
the growth of hyphae results in discoloration and a fuzzy appearance, especially
on food. The network of these tubular branching hyphae, called a mycelium, is
considered a single organism. The hyphae are generally transparent, so the
mycelium appears like very fine, fluffy white threads over the surface. Cross-
walls (septa) may delimit connected compartments along the hyphae, each
containing one or multiple, genetically identical nuclei. The dusty texture of
many molds is caused by profuse production of asexual spores (conidia) formed by
differentiation at the ends of hyphae. The mode of formation and shape of these
spores is traditionally used to classify molds. Many of these spores are
colored, making the fungus much more obvious to the human eye at this stage in
its life-cycle.

Molds are considered to be microbes and do not form a specific taxonomic or
phylogenetic grouping, but can be found in the divisions Zygomycota and
Ascomycota. In the past, most molds were classified within the Deuteromycota.

Molds cause biodegradation of natural materials, which can be unwanted when it
becomes food spoilage or damage to property. They also play important roles in
biotechnology and food science in the production of various foods, beverages,
antibiotics, pharmaceuticals and enzymes. Some diseases of animals and humans
can be caused by certain molds: disease may result from allergic sensitivity to
mold spores, from growth of pathogenic molds within the body, or from the
effects of ingested or inhaled toxic compounds (mycotoxins) produced by molds.

]]

A 'constitution' is an aggregate of fundamental principles or established
precedents that constitute the legal basis of a polity, organisation or other
type of entity, and commonly determine how that entity is to be governed.The
[[New Oxford American Dictionary]], Second Edn., Erin McKean (editor), 2051 pp.,
2005, Oxford University Press, .

When these principles are written down into a single document or set of legal
documents, those documents may be said to embody a written constitution; if they
are written down in a single comprehensive document, it is said to embody a
codified constitution. Some constitutions (such as the constitution of the
United Kingdom) are uncodified, but written in numerous fundamental Acts of a
legislature, court cases or treaties.[[R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary
of State for Transport]] [2014] [http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2014/3.html
UKSC 3], [207]

Constitutions concern different levels of organizations, from sovereign
countries to companies and unincorporated associations. A treaty which
establishes an international organization is also its constitution, in that it
would define how that organization is constituted. Within states, a constitution
defines the principles upon which the state is based, the procedure in which
laws are made and by whom. Some constitutions, especially codified
constitutions, also act as limiters of state power, by establishing lines which
a state's rulers cannot cross, such as fundamental rights.

The Constitution of India is the longest written constitution of any country in
the world, containing 444 articles in 22 parts, 12 schedules and 118 amendments,
