The 'domestic dog' (Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the
wolf or Canis familiaris when considered a distinct species) is a member of the
genus [[Canis]] (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the
most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are
sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were
first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is
extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been
selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and
physical attributes.

Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human
behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be
inadequate for other canid species. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors.[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/different-dog-breeds-same-

'Bears' are carnivoran mammals of the family 'Ursidae'. They are classified as
caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are
extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout
the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are
found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.
Common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs,
long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five
nonretractile claws, and short tails.

While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost
entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets.
With the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears
are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an
excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are
adept runners, climbers, and swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and
logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long
period of hibernation, up to 100 days.

Bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have
been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made
to dance. With their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in
the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In
modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their
habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market.
The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least
concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain
countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened
populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.

'Fish' are gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits.
They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores.
Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous
and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged
within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However,
traditionally fish are rendered paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e.,
the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the
same ancestry). Because in this manner the term "fish" is defined negatively as
a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in
systematic biology, unless it is used in the cladistic sense, including
tetrapods. The traditional term 'pisces' (also 'ichthyes') is considered a , but
not a phylogenetic classification.

The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates
that first appeared during the Cambrian period. Although they lacked a true
spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their
invertebrate counterparts. Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic
era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic
developed external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with
jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became
formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.

Most fish are ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), allowing their body temperatures to
vary as ambient temperatures change, though some of the large active swimmers
like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature.

Fish can communicate in their underwater environments through the use of
acoustic communication. Acoustic communication in fish involves the transmission
of acoustic signals from one individual of a species to another. The production
of sounds as a means of communication among fish is most often used in the
context of feeding, aggression or courtship behaviour. The sounds emitted by
fish can vary depending on the species and stimulus involved. They can produce
either stridulatory sounds by moving components of the skeletal system, or can
produce non-stridulatory sounds by manipulating specialized organs such as the
swimbladder.

Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all
aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the
abyssal and even hadal depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and
anglerfish), although no species has yet been documented in the deepest 25% of
the ocean. With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity
than any other group of vertebrates.

Fish are an important resource for humans worldwide, especially as food.
Commercial and subsistence fishers hunt fish in wild fisheries (see fishing)
or farm them in ponds or in cages in the ocean (see aquaculture). They are
also caught by recreational fishers, kept as pets, raised by fishkeepers, and
exhibited in public aquaria. Fish have had a role in culture through the
ages, serving as deities, religious symbols, and as the subjects of art,
books and movies.

The 'Mona Lisa' (; or 'La Gioconda' , ) is a half-length portrait painting by
the Italian Renaissance artist Leonardo da Vinci that has been described as "the
best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the
most parodied work of art in the world." The Mona Lisa is also one of the most
valuable paintings in the world. It holds the Guinness World Record for the
highest known insurance valuation in history at US$100 million in 1962
(equivalent to $ million in ).

The painting is a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del
Giocondo, and is in oil on a white Lombardy poplar panel. It had been believed
to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued
working on it as late as 1517. Recent academic work suggests that it would not
have been started before 1513. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and
is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Louvre
Museum in Paris since 1797.

The subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the
monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the
atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the
continuing fascination and study of the work.

}} A 'car' (or 'automobile') is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation.
Most definitions of car say they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight
people, have four tires, and mainly transport people rather than goods.

Cars came into global use during the 20th century, and developed economies
depend on them. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car
when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars became
widely available in the early 20th century. One of the first cars accessible to
the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor
Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced animal-drawn
carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and
other parts of the world.

Cars have controls for driving, parking, passenger comfort, and safety, and
controlling a variety of lights. Over the decades, additional features and
controls have been added to vehicles, making them progressively more complex.
These include rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and
in-car entertainment. Most cars in use in the 2010s are propelled by an internal
combustion engine, fueled by the combustion of fossil fuels. Electric cars,
which were invented early in the history of the car, began to become
commercially available in 2008.

There are costs and benefits to car use. The costs include acquiring the
vehicle, interest payments (if the car is financed), repairs and maintenance,
fuel, depreciation, driving time, parking fees, taxes, and insurance. The costs
to society include maintaining roads, land use, road congestion, air pollution,
public health, health care, and disposing of the vehicle at the end of its life.
Road traffic accidents are the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide.

The benefits include on-demand transportation, mobility, independence, and
convenience. The societal benefits include economic benefits, such as job and
wealth creation from the automotive industry, transportation provision, societal
well-being from leisure and travel opportunities, and revenue generation from
the . People's ability to move flexibly from place to place has far-reaching
implications for the nature of societies. There are around 1 billion cars in use
worldwide. The numbers are increasing rapidly, especially in China, India and
other newly industrialized countries.

The 'Walt Disney World Resort', also called 'Walt Disney World' and 'Disney
World', is an entertainment complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida,
in the United States, near the cities Orlando and Kissimmee. Opened on October
1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and
Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was first operated by Walt
Disney World Company. The property, which covers nearly , only half of which
has been used, comprises four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven
themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping
resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center
Disney Springs.

Designed to supplement Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, which had opened in
1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. "The Florida
Project", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its
own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the
inclusion of an "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (EPCOT), a
planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living
innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during construction of the
complex. Without him spearheading the construction, the company built a resort
similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned
community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in
1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's
Animal Kingdom (1998).

Today, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with
average annual attendance of more than 52 million. The resort is the flagship
destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a popular
staple in American culture.

'Central Park' is an urban park in Manhattan, New York City. It is located
between the Upper West Side and Upper East Side, roughly bounded by Fifth
Avenue on the east, Central Park West (Eighth Avenue) on the west, Central Park
South (59th Street) on the south, and Central Park North (110th Street) on the
north. Central Park is the most visited urban park in the United States, with
40 million visitors in 2013, and one of the most filmed locations in the world.
In terms of area, Central Park is the fifth largest park in New York City,
covering .

Central Park was first approved in 1853 as a . In 1857, landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted and architect/landscape designer Calvert Vaux won a design
competition to construct the park with a plan they titled the "Greensward Plan".
Construction began the same year, and the park's first areas were opened to the
public in late 1858. Additional land at the northern end of Central Park was
purchased in 1859, and the park was completed in 1873. After a period of decline
in the early 20th century, New York City parks commissioner Robert Moses started
a program to clean up Central Park. Another decline in the late 20th century
spurred the creation of the Central Park Conservancy in 1980, which refurbished
many parts of the park during the 1980s and 1990s.

Central Park was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department
of the Interior in 1963,https://npgallery.nps.gov/AssetDetail/NRIS/66000538 and
