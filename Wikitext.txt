The 'Walt Disney World Resort', also called 'Walt Disney World' and 'Disney
World', is an entertainment complex in Bay Lake and Lake Buena Vista, Florida,
in the United States, near the cities Orlando and Kissimmee. Opened on October
1, 1971, the resort is owned and operated by Disney Parks, Experiences and
Products, a division of The Walt Disney Company. It was first operated by Walt
Disney World Company. The property, which covers nearly , only half of which
has been used, comprises four theme parks, two water parks, twenty-seven
themed resort hotels, nine non-Disney hotels, several golf courses, a camping
resort, and other entertainment venues, including the outdoor shopping center
Disney Springs.

Designed to supplement Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, which had opened in
1955, the complex was developed by Walt Disney in the 1960s. "The Florida
Project", as it was known, was intended to present a distinct vision with its
own diverse set of attractions. Walt Disney's original plans also called for the
inclusion of an "Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow" (EPCOT), a
planned community intended to serve as a test bed for new city-living
innovations. Walt Disney died on December 15, 1966, during construction of the
complex. Without him spearheading the construction, the company built a resort
similar to Disneyland, abandoning the experimental concepts for a planned
community. Magic Kingdom was the first theme park to open in the complex, in
1971, followed by Epcot (1982), Disney's Hollywood Studios (1989), and Disney's
Animal Kingdom (1998).

Today, Walt Disney World is the most visited vacation resort in the world, with
average annual attendance of more than 52 million. The resort is the flagship
destination of Disney's worldwide corporate enterprise and has become a popular
staple in American culture.
