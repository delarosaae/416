'Bread' is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually by
baking. Throughout recorded history it has been a prominent food in large parts
of the world and is one of the oldest man-made foods, having been of significant
importance since the dawn of agriculture.

Bread may be leavened by processes such as reliance on naturally occurring
sourdough microbes, chemicals, industrially produced yeast, or high-pressure
aeration. Commercial bread commonly contains additives to improve flavor,
texture, color, shelf life, nutrition, and ease of manufacturing.

Bread plays essential roles in religious rituals and secular culture.
